Analysis of financial records using javascript

## Description 

This is a JavaScript (JS) application that analyses financial data and outputs the results to the Console Log. 

As a front-end web developer javascript is an important scripting language that enables the implementation of complex features on a web page, it can be deployed to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and has many other uses besides.

I have developed this JS app to demonstrate a real-world situation utilising a financial dataset.

During the development of this app I have learned and applied the following;

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Pseudocoding</strong> - Planning is an important part of working out how to develop an app, pseudocode enables you to understand the individual steps and logic required from start to finish.</li>    
    <li><strong>Variables</strong> - Identify & declare variables containing primitive data types</li>
    <li><strong>Arrays</strong> - An array is a single variable that is used to store different elements.</li>
    <li><strong>for</strong> - A control flow statement for specifiying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly</li>
    <li><strong>if</strong> - A statement to specify a block of JS code to be executed if a condition is true</li>
    <li><strong>console.log</strong> - A statement that prints content to the debugger</li>

</ul>

A financial dataset is already provided, in order to analyse other datasets simply replace the existing array set ensuring that the same syntax is maintained i.e. ['string', number];
